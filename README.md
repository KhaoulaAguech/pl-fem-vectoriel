#  PL-FEM Vectoriel: A Modular FEM Framework for Fully Vectorial Simulation and Dataset Generation of Polymer Photonic Lantern Multiplexers/Demultiplexers:
PL-FEM Vectoriel is a research-grade Python framework for fully vectorial finite-element simulation and large-scale parametric dataset generation of polymer photonic lantern multiplexers/demultiplexers (PL MUX/DEMUX). The framework is specifically designed for high-index-contrast polymer/air systems (e.g., IP-Dip), where hybrid HE/EH modal behavior and polarization coupling invalidate scalar approximations.
